## AbsDistinct

*Easy*

**Compute number of distinct absolute values of sorted array elements.**

A non-empty array A consisting of N numbers is given. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The absolute distinct count of this array is the number of distinct absolute values among the elements of the array.

For example, consider array A such that:

    A[0] = -5
    A[1] = -3
    A[2] = -1
    A[3] =  0
    A[4] =  3
    A[5] =  6

The absolute distinct count of this array is 5, because there are 5 distinct absolute values among the elements of this array, namely 0, 1, 3, 5 and 6.

Write a function:

    def solution(a)

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N numbers, returns absolute distinct count of array A.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = -5
    A[1] = -3
    A[2] = -1
    A[3] =  0
    A[4] =  3
    A[5] =  6

the function should return 5, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647];
  array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## CountDistinctSlices

*Easy*

**Count the number of distinct slices (containing only unique numbers).**

An integer M and a non-empty array A consisting of N non-negative integers are given. All integers in array A are less than or equal to M.

A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 ≤ P ≤ Q < N, is called a slice of array A. The slice consists of the elements A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[Q]. A distinct slice is a slice consisting of only unique numbers. That is, no individual number occurs more than once in the slice.

For example, consider integer M = 6 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 2
There are exactly nine distinct slices: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 4).

The goal is to calculate the number of distinct slices.

Write a function:

def solution(m, a)

that, given an integer M and a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct slices.

If the number of distinct slices is greater than 1,000,000,000, the function should return 1,000,000,000.

For example, given integer M = 6 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 2
the function should return 9, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
  M is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..M].

## CountTriangles

*Easy*

**Count the number of triangles that can be built from a given set of edges.**

An array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if it is possible to build a triangle with sides of lengths A[P], A[Q] and A[R]. In other words, triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 ≤ P < Q < R < N and:

  A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
  A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
  A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].

For example, consider array A such that:

    A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 12

There are four triangular triplets that can be constructed from elements of this array, namely (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 4, 5), and (2, 4, 5).

Write a function:

    def solution(a)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of triangular triplets in this array.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
    A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 12

the function should return 4, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [0..1,000];
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

## MinAbsSumOfTwo

*Medium*

**Find the minimal absolute value of a sum of two elements.**

Let A be a non-empty array consisting of N integers.

The abs sum of two for a pair of indices (P, Q) is the absolute value |A[P] + A[Q]|, for 0 ≤ P ≤ Q < N.

For example, the following array A:

    A[0] =  1
    A[1] =  4
    A[2] = -3

  has pairs of indices (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2).
  The abs sum of two for the pair (0, 0) is A[0] + A[0] = |1 + 1| = 2.
  The abs sum of two for the pair (0, 1) is A[0] + A[1] = |1 + 4| = 5.
  The abs sum of two for the pair (0, 2) is A[0] + A[2] = |1 + (−3)| = 2.
  The abs sum of two for the pair (1, 1) is A[1] + A[1] = |4 + 4| = 8.
  The abs sum of two for the pair (1, 2) is A[1] + A[2] = |4 + (−3)| = 1.
  The abs sum of two for the pair (2, 2) is A[2] + A[2] = |(−3) + (−3)| = 6.

Write a function:

```ruby
def solution(a)
```

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimal abs sum of two for any pair of indices in this array.

For example, given the following array A:

    A[0] =  1
    A[1] =  4
    A[2] = -3

the function should return 1, as explained above.

Given array A:

    A[0] = -8
    A[1] =  4
    A[2] =  5
    A[3] =-10
    A[4] =  3

the function should return |(−8) + 5| = 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].
