## MaxNonoverlappingSegments

*Easy*

**Find a maximal set of non-overlapping segments.**

Located on a line are N segments, numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose positions are given in arrays A and B. For each I (0 ≤ I < N) the position of segment I is from A[I] to B[I] (inclusive). The segments are sorted by their ends, which means that B[K] ≤ B[K + 1] for K such that 0 ≤ K < N − 1.

Two segments I and J, such that I ≠ J, are overlapping if they share at least one common point. In other words, A[I] ≤ A[J] ≤ B[I] or A[J] ≤ A[I] ≤ B[J].

We say that the set of segments is non-overlapping if it contains no two overlapping segments. The goal is to find the size of a non-overlapping set containing the maximal number of segments.

For example, consider arrays A, B such that:

    A[0] = 1    B[0] = 5
    A[1] = 3    B[1] = 6
    A[2] = 7    B[2] = 8
    A[3] = 9    B[3] = 9
    A[4] = 9    B[4] = 10

The segments are shown in the figure below.

The size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments is 3. For example, possible sets are {0, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3} or {1, 2, 4}. There is no non-overlapping set with four segments.

Write a function:

    def solution(a, b)

that, given two arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments.

For example, given arrays A, B shown above, the function should return 3, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [0..30,000];
  each element of arrays A and B is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000];
  A[I] ≤ B[I], for each I (0 ≤ I < N);
  B[K] ≤ B[K + 1], for each K (0 ≤ K < N − 1).

## TieRopes

*Easy*

**Tie adjacent ropes to achieve the maximum number of ropes of length >= K.**

There are N ropes numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose lengths are given in an array A, lying on the floor in a line. For each I (0 ≤ I < N), the length of rope I on the line is A[I].

We say that two ropes I and I + 1 are adjacent. Two adjacent ropes can be tied together with a knot, and the length of the tied rope is the sum of lengths of both ropes. The resulting new rope can then be tied again.

For a given integer K, the goal is to tie the ropes in such a way that the number of ropes whose length is greater than or equal to K is maximal.

For example, consider K = 4 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 1
    A[6] = 3
The ropes are shown in the figure below.

  ![ropes](../../assets/images/ropes.png)

We can tie:

  rope 1 with rope 2 to produce a rope of length A[1] + A[2] = 5;
  rope 4 with rope 5 with rope 6 to produce a rope of length A[4] + A[5] + A[6] = 5.

After that, there will be three ropes whose lengths are greater than or equal to K = 4. It is not possible to produce four such ropes.

Write a function:

    def solution(k, a)

that, given an integer K and a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of ropes of length greater than or equal to K that can be created.

For example, given K = 4 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 1
    A[6] = 3

the function should return 3, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
  K is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
