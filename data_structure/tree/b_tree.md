# B-Tree

- A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
- The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for multiple keys per node.

## Common operations:
  - Search: Find a key in the tree
  - Insert: Add a new key to the tree
  - Delete: Remove a key from the tree

## Common use cases:
  - Database indexing
  - File systems

## B+ Trees
- A B+ tree is a type of self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
- The B+ tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for multiple keys per node.
- Common operations:
  - Search: Find a key in the tree
  - Insert: Add a new key to the tree
  - Delete: Remove a key from the tree
- Common use cases:
  - Database indexing
  - File systems
